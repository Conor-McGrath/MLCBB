This project makes college basketball predicitons for the upcoming 2020-2021 season for both men's and women's college basketball. 

The data used in the model goes back to 2003 for men's games and 2010 for women's games. 
The majority of the historical data comes from Kenneth Massey. 
The csv files largely came from Kaggle as part of the Google Cloud & NCAA March Madness Analytics Challege with 2021 season schedules from ESPN.


The app.r file contains the r shiny app that is used to view predictions for the upcoming season. 
The .feather files contain logos for the teams.

There are 6 rmd files used to ultimately create these predictions (Data Wrangling, Prediction Setup, and Models for each of men's and women's). The rda files are written throughout the rmd files and are included for convenience to avoid running time-consuming loops.

The final report pdf contains the written analysis of the findings and the presentation.pdf contains slides used when presenting the model.
